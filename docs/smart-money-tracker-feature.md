# Smart Money Tracker - Main Feature Proposal

## The Problem Users Have
- Casual bettors always feel like they're "late to the party"
- They place bets based on gut feeling while insiders/sharps have already moved the market
- They don't have time to monitor odds 24/7
- They miss opportunities when odds offer value

## The Solution: Smart Money Tracker

### 1. **Real-Time Movement Alerts** 🚨

### 2. **Movement Patterns Library** 📊
Teach users to recognize patterns:

```
Common Patterns:

1. "The Injury Drift" 
   - Steady favorite suddenly drifts

   - Professional money taking value
   - Best time to follow: within 10 mins

3. "The Public Fade"
   - Gradual drift on popular team
   - Sharps betting against public
   - Profitable to follow: 64% of time
```

### 3. **Smart Money Score** 💡
For each match, calculate a "Smart Money Score":

```sql
CREATE OR REPLACE FUNCTION calculate_smart_money_score(p_event_id INT)
RETURNS TABLE (
    market_code VARCHAR,
    outcome VARCHAR,
    smart_money_score DECIMAL, -- 0-100
    movement_type VARCHAR,
    confidence_level VARCHAR
) AS $$
BEGIN
    RETURN QUERY
    WITH movements AS (
        SELECT 
            mt.code,
            co.outcome,
            co.movement_percentage,
            co.total_movement,
            oh.changes_count,
            oh.avg_change_size,
            oh.time_concentration, -- How clustered the changes are
            oh.direction_consistency -- Are changes all one direction
        FROM current_odds co
        JOIN market_types mt ON co.market_type_id = mt.id
        JOIN (
            SELECT 
                event_id,
                market_type_id,
                outcome,
                COUNT(*) as changes_count,
                AVG(ABS(change_percentage)) as avg_change_size,
                STDDEV(EXTRACT(EPOCH FROM recorded_at)) as time_concentration,
                ABS(SUM(change_percentage)) / SUM(ABS(change_percentage)) as direction_consistency
            FROM odds_history
            WHERE event_id = p_event_id
            GROUP BY event_id, market_type_id, outcome
        ) oh ON co.event_id = oh.event_id 
            AND co.market_type_id = oh.market_type_id 
            AND co.outcome = oh.outcome
    )
    SELECT 
        code,
        outcome,
        -- Score based on multiple factors
        LEAST(100, GREATEST(0,
            (movement_percentage * 0.3) +  -- Size of movement
            (changes_count * 2) +           -- Frequency of changes
            (direction_consistency * 50) +   -- Consistent direction
            (1/time_concentration * 20)     -- Concentrated timeframe
        )) as smart_money_score,
        CASE 
            WHEN movement_percentage > 50 AND direction_consistency > 0.8 THEN 'SHARP_MOVE'
            WHEN changes_count > 10 AND time_concentration < 3600 THEN 'VOLATILE_NEWS'
            WHEN movement_percentage < -30 THEN 'VALUE_CRASH'
            ELSE 'NORMAL'
        END as movement_type,
        CASE 
            WHEN movement_percentage > 100 THEN 'HIGH'
            WHEN movement_percentage > 50 THEN 'MEDIUM'
            ELSE 'LOW'
        END as confidence_level
    FROM movements;
END;
$$ LANGUAGE plpgsql;
```
