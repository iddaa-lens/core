## üî• Feature #1: "Smart Money Tracker" - Live Odds Movement Intelligence

**The Hook**: *"See where the sharp money is going in real-time"*

### What It Does
Provides professional-level market intelligence by tracking and analyzing real-time odds movements to identify where smart money (professional bettors) is placing their bets.

### Key Components
- **Real-time odds movement alerts** when odds shift >20% or multiply >2x
- **"Follow the Sharks"** dashboard highlighting when odds move against public betting patterns
- **Movement heatmap** visualization showing which outcomes are getting hammered vs drifting
- **Smart notifications**: "üö® Real Madrid odds just dropped 40% - sharp money detected!"
- **Reverse line movement alerts** when odds move opposite to betting volume

### Data Sources Used
- `odds_history` table for historical movement tracking
- `current_odds` for real-time comparisons  
- `big_movers` view for significant movement detection
- `betting_volume_history` for volume analysis

### Why It Works
Bettors are obsessed with finding edge and "insider information". This feature gives them professional-level market intelligence that makes them feel like insiders, creating strong engagement and platform stickiness.

## ‚ö° Feature #2: "Value Hunter" - AI-Powered Betting Distribution Analysis

**The Hook**: *"Beat the bookmaker with crowd psychology insights"*

### What It Does
Exploits fundamental betting psychology by showing users when the public is wrong, providing contrarian betting opportunities that professional bettors use to generate long-term profits.

### Key Components
- **Public vs Smart Money dashboard** showing betting percentages vs actual odds value
- **"Fade the Public" alerts** when >60% of bets are on statistically overvalued outcomes
- **Value score calculator** comparing implied probability vs betting distribution
- **Live examples**: "78% of bets on Chelsea, but odds suggest only 45% chance - FADE OPPORTUNITY!"
