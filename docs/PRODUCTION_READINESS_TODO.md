# Production Readiness TODO - Cron Jobs

Based on comprehensive review by Copilot Opus, this document outlines critical improvements needed for production-ready cron job execution.

## Critical Issues Identified

### üö® Priority 1 - Immediate (Data Integrity Risk)

#### 1. Distributed Locking

**Problem**: Multiple Kubernetes replicas can run the same job simultaneously, causing:

- Data corruption
- Duplicate processing  
- Race conditions
- Inconsistent state

**Current Risk**: HIGH - Production has multiple pod replicas
**Implementation**: PostgreSQL advisory locks

#### 2. Monitoring & Metrics Blind Spots

**Problem**: No observability into job execution:

- No metrics collection
- No health checks per job
- No alerting on failures
- No performance tracking

**Current Risk**: HIGH - Flying blind in production
**Implementation**: Prometheus metrics + health checks

#### 3. Memory Issues in High-Volume Jobs

**Problem**: Jobs load all data into memory:

- `detailed_odds_sync.go` loads all events at once
- Potential OOM in production
- Poor scalability

**Current Risk**: MEDIUM - Could cause pod crashes
**Implementation**: Pagination and streaming

### ‚ö†Ô∏è Priority 2 - High (Reliability & Performance)

#### 4. Incomplete Circuit Breaker Coverage

**Problem**: External API failures can cascade:

- Iddaa API (partially addressed)
- OpenAI API (no protection)
- No comprehensive failure handling

**Current Risk**: MEDIUM - API outages affect multiple jobs
**Implementation**: Circuit breaker pattern for all external APIs

#### 5. Database Connection Management

**Problem**: No connection limiting per job:

- No proper transaction management in batch operations
- Potential connection pool exhaustion
- No transaction boundaries for data consistency

**Current Risk**: MEDIUM - Could affect database performance
**Implementation**: Connection limiting + transaction boundaries

#### 6. Idempotency Gaps

**Problem**: Some operations lack idempotency guarantees:

- Jobs can create duplicate data if run multiple times
- Retry logic may cause inconsistency

**Current Risk**: MEDIUM - Data consistency issues
**Implementation**: Idempotency checks and keys

### üìà Priority 3 - Medium (Operational Excellence)

#### 7. Race Conditions Between Jobs

**Problem**: Multiple jobs updating same data without coordination:

- `volume_sync` and `distribution_sync` can conflict
- `detailed_odds_sync` and `events_sync` can race

**Current Risk**: LOW - Mostly handled by database constraints
**Implementation**: Job dependency management

#### 8. Advanced Error Handling

**Problem**: Jobs continue processing after errors:

- Can lead to partial data states
- Insufficient error boundaries

**Current Risk**: LOW - Recently improved significantly
**Implementation**: Enhanced error boundaries and rollback

#### 9. Graceful Shutdown

**Problem**: Jobs don't handle shutdown gracefully:

- No proper cleanup on termination
- Potential data loss on pod restart

**Current Risk**: LOW - Jobs are generally idempotent
**Implementation**: Graceful shutdown with timeout

## Architecture Components to Implement

### 1. Production Job Wrapper

```go
type ProductionJob struct {
    job Job
    lockManager *JobLockManager
    metrics *JobMetrics
    circuitBreaker *CircuitBreaker
    healthChecker *JobHealthChecker
}
```

### 2. Distributed Lock Manager

```go
type JobLockManager interface {
    AcquireLock(ctx context.Context, jobName string) (bool, error)
    ReleaseLock(ctx context.Context, jobName string) error
    IsLocked(ctx context.Context, jobName string) (bool, error)
}
```

### 3. Job Metrics System

```go
type JobMetrics struct {
    Duration prometheus.Histogram
    Successes prometheus.Counter
    Failures prometheus.Counter
    ActiveJobs prometheus.Gauge
}
```

### 4. Health Check Interface

```go
type HealthCheckableJob interface {
    Job
    HealthCheck(ctx context.Context) error
    GetStatus(ctx context.Context) JobStatus
}
```
